                <p>Emerald green streams, rousing waves, and picturesque riverscapes ‚Äì the outdoor activity of white water rafting is ideal for all nature lovers and (soon-to-be) adventure sports enthusiasts. Rafting requires coordination and team spirit ‚Äì those who have already sat in a rubber raft with their companions and fought against the primal force of the water, will certainly not forget this experience any time soon. This is why white water rafting tours are becoming more and more popular, not only with families and groups of friends but also for team building events and stag and hen parties.</p>

                <p>Clear, alpine waters flow from the behemoth Dartmouth Dam into the Mitta Mitta River, creating massive waves and conditions similar to Canada and NZ. With the longest grade four rapids commercially available in Victoria and expert guides offering tours, this is where you get your thrills.</p>

                <p>Whitewater rafting is an exciting way to explore nature. It‚Äôs also terrific exercise and offers quite a few benefits that can improve your health and overall lifestyle. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre raging wild Class IV and V rapids or gently floating downstream. Both can improve your physical and mental health.</p>
